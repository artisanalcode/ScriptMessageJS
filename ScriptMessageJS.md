## Spread the word

Teaching others about programming is something we can all do.

## Make it fun!

Games are a great way to engage people, and a fun way to learn. So in order to teach a few basic concepts of programming we took an existing game and use it to share some ideas and concepts.
Love Letter, a card game designed by Seiji Kanai, is a very simple and fun game that lends itself very well to be re-skinned for teaching purposes. The rules are simple and there are already many official and unofficial re-skins.

#### But... is it legal?
Not a lawyer, but:
- In the US courts have declared that game mechanics cannot be copyrighted.
- US and Canadian Law among others provide Fair Use or Fair Dealing exceptions for education, parody and satire.

## Here it is

I will provide you the content for you to create your own game:

### Cards
| Value | Name | Quantity |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unit test | 5 |
| 2 | Breakpoint | 2 |
| 3 | Event | 2 |
| 4 | Functional Programming | 2 |
| 5 | Variable | 2 |
| 6 | Object | 1 |
| 7 | Immutable Object | 1 |
| 8 | Function  | 1 |
| N/A | Helper Card (optional) | 4 |


### Suggested Content for Cards
For my version I have printed the "concept" on the card and left the "instructions" on a helper card.

| Name | Concept | Instructions |
|---|---|---|
| Unit test | A method by which units of code are scrutinized to determine if they behave as expected. | When discarded, chose a player and name a non-unit test card. If it matches a card in his hand. The player is out of the round. |
| Breakpoint | A point in a which program processing is stoped to allow a developer to examine it. | When discarded, chose a player and look at his hand. Do not reveal. |
| Event | An event is an occurrence to which software can respond by waiting for and defining a response. | When discarded. choose a player. Compare hands. Player with the lowest hand is out of the round. |
| Functional Programming | A style of programming that avoids changing states and mutating values. | When discarded, you will be immune to the effects of other cards until the start of your next round. |
| Variable | Storage for a value that can change during program execution. | When discarded, chose a player, even yourself. Player then discards his hand and takes a card from the deck. |
| Object | An object can combine state (data) and behavior (code). |  |
| Immutable Object | An object whose state cannot be modified after created. | When discarded, no effect. If you have it, and a 5 or 6, you must discard it. |
| Function |  One of the fundamental blocks of programming. It performs a task or calculates a value. | When discarded, from your hand, you are out of the round. |
